- Tooltips that depict variable contents while the program execution is interrupted
- Expressions get evaluated using the expression evaluator and variable contents read from of the memory

- toString() execution for objects:
	- Inject a client dll into the program
	- Connect to the mono-d-debugger server via a named pipe
	- let the debugger extension pass the raw object pointer to the client dll
	- the client dll will convert the pointer to an object ("dynamic reinterpration")
	- the object's toString() method will be executed
	- the built string will be passed back to the debugger
	- the string will be taken as an object value representation in the locals tree view or as a tooltip
	-> Top notch .Net-debugging like user experience

(- probably also execute property functions to get further information, 
	get TypeInfo-objects [always client-side, to get information about property getters - and execute them then], 
	examine virtual tables)
